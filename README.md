# ZumoSwap Smart Contracts

## Credits
This is a fork of several repositories from VeChain Community public source code.
https://github.com/VeChainDEXCode/uni-v2

All tests passed.

# For Developers
```bash
/uniswap-lib            # util libraries
/uniswap-v2-core        # core contracts for assets
/uniswap-v2-periphery   # surrounding contract for user interface
```

```bash
make install # install dependencies.
make compile # Compile all contracts.
make test # Run all the tests.
```

This is compatible with VeChain after update of thor `1.5.1`
